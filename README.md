# Time Tracking tool

Use [todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) in `~/todo.txt` and
`~/done.txt`. Tt will operate on these two files.

Tt will read both `todo.txt` and `done.txt` files for analysis, but it will
always insert new items in the `todo.txt` file, even if they are items already
marked as done with the `x ` prefix. This is so that you have a chance to edit
the lines generated by tt before archiving them and treating the `done.txt`
file as more of a write-only store.

Tt has logic that depends on the ordering of items, but it always sorts the
items itself based on their timestamps and ignores the physical order the
lines are found in the `done.txt` and `todo.txt` log files.

## TODO items

Handled by todo.txt conventions, tt won't do much with these. However, it does
provide "todo" and "done" commands to add a new open item or add a done item.

## Time tracking

Clock in and out of projects, this generates lines in your todo.txt file:

    tt in my-project
    tt out Frobnicated the macguffin

Comments after `tt in [project]` and `tt out` are optional.

Tt can convert its clock entries into [Emacs
timeclock.el](http://hledger.org/timeclock.html) compatible format understood
by [hledger](http://hledger.org/) with the `timeclock` command.

You can then use hledger to analyze your hours and generate reports:

    tt timeclock | hledger -f - balance

Use tt to show the name of the currently clocked project and the hours clocked
on it today:

    tt current

This is useful for status displays like a custom command prompt or a desktop
status bar to have your clock situation visible at a glance.
